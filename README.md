Continuous Integration
is the practice of integrating changes from different developers in the team into a mainline as early as possible, in best cases several times a day. This makes sure the code individual developers work on doesnâ€™t divert too much. When you combine the process with automated testing, continuous integration can enable your code to be dependable.

Continuous Deployment
is closely related to Continuous Integration and refers to keeping your application deployable at any point or even automatically releasing to a test or production environment if the latest version passes all automated tests.

Continuous Delivery
is the practice of keeping your codebase deployable at any point. Beyond making sure your application passes automated tests it has to have all the configuration necessary to push it into production. Many teams then do push changes that pass the automated tests into a test or production environment immediately to ensure a fast development loop.
